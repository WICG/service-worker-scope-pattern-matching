This repository proposes creating a native web API to match URLs called URLPattern.  URLPattern would support both web developer use in JS and native URL matching in other web APIs.  For example, the initial use cases discuss using URLPattern for service worker scope matching.

For more information:

* The [URLPattern documentation](mdn-drafts/QUICK-REFERENCE.md) describes the final API shape and provides a number of examples.
* The [December 2020 update](202012-update.md) describes the API shape and implementation status at the time.
* The [explainer](explainer.md) discusses the motivating use cases and early API ideas.
* The [design document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17L6b3zlTHtyxQvOAvbK55gQOi5rrJLERwjt_sKXpzqc/edit) goes into more detail, including webidl and how the API might be implemented in Chromium.  Some of this has changed during implementation.  See the [latest update](202012-update.md) for the most recent API shape.
